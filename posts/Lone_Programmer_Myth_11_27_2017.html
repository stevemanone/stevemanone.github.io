Another week, another dollar (is that how the saying goes?).  This week I've been making progress in learning improving skills in JS (node), Python, and Java.  I've been working with a couple people on the interactive video project (<a href="https://github.com/Delhi2Boston/PhonesFirst">link</a>), as well as the start up (<a href="http://www.jobget.com">www.jobget.com</a>) </p><p>We spent today going through how to write "stories", which are collections of videos that are woven together to form a cohesive narrative about a subject or character.  Specifically, we discussed how to 'translate' the 'language' of film making, with its time codes and use of themes and narratives, to the 'language' (am I overusing the quotes?  I'll stop haha) of programming, with it's need for logic and explicit instructions.  We wanted to make sure that we were all on the same page, that we could communicate what needed to be done in a way that was technical enough to be understood by an engineer, but not so much that it was inaccessible by the film maker. </p><p>As the three of us chatted, I began to realize this back and forth is really what I love most about programming and software development.  The teamwork (yea cheesy, I know!).  Being interested in programming these days often requires a good grasp of fundamental technical communication skills, being able to articulate complex ideas to both a non-technical audience as well as to engineering colleagues.  With the rise of GitHub/StackOver Flow/open source projects, the concept of a completely lone isolated programmer, hacking away in their dark basement isn't accurate anymore (if it ever was...).  The process of talking <i> about </i> code, about how one wants use technologies and what stack/architecture one wants to use, about how to frame the goal, about which technical targets are realistic/too ambitious all requires an ability to dynamically assess the technical literacy of your audience and re-adjust your language as necessary.  </p><p>Software has become infinity more complex over time, and open source distribution of responsibility has made it essential to be able to communicate with a large community of other engineers, all striving for the same goal.  As software grows in complexity, the number of people that need to participate in software development has increased as well.  This has led to many new gradations in software development, from lead developers, to project/product managers, to sales engineers, customer facing support managers, IT staff, dev ops, to operations engineers, each of whom may posses their own technical vocabulary, and space of expertise and understanding.  Communication, and the honest wresting of ideas and technical trade offs that comes with it, is probably one of my <i> favorite </i> parts of software engineer. </p><br><p class="gray">-Steve</p><footer></footer><br/><br/><a href="/" class="gray">Back</a></div></div></article><hr></body></html>
