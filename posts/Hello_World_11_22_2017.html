Gosh there is truly an amazing time to be working in programming and software.  The sheer amount of interesting areas (from AI, to machine learning, to big data, to web/mobile development) coupled with an incredible suite of (free) online resources means that anyone with a computer and internet access has an incredible opportunity to learn and create.  </p><p>This week, I've been looking through GitHub for projects that I can contribute to.  I am most comfortable in Javascript, Java and Python, although R and Rudy (on Rails) are also really interesting.  A project that I'm been perusing most recently is with Anadana Kapur, an amazing Indian film maker crafting an "interactive" film from footage she's captured of Indian women of various social backgrounds.  This project is going to be technically challenging (she has terabytes of video that need to be displayed via both a desktop website as well as mobile platform!) as well as a significant creative undertaking.  Anadana is passionate about creating an experience where the audience isn't merely just a passive observer, but instead can follow branching story lines that follow different character narratives.  This project has just begun, but you can follow (and contribute to!) our progress on our GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/Delhi2Boston/PhonesFirst">here</a>.  </p><p>Lastly, I've been very excited about the startup that I've been working on, JobGet.  It's been a fascinating experience, although the number of things that need to get done is certainly daunting, it's also exhilarating helping to build something and watch it grow on such a large scale.  Our company plans to launch the MVP (minimum viable product) in mid-December, and their website can be found at <a href="https://www.jobget.com">www.jobget.com</a>     </p><hr><h5>Quick Notes from the Week</h5><ul> <li><p>Man I forgot how annoying binary trees are haha (from Cracking the Coding Interview).</p></li><li> <p>Constantly switching between the light readability of Python and the painful verbosity of Java is hurting my brain. </p></li></ul><footer></footer><br/><br/><a href="/" class="gray">Back</a></div></div></article><hr></body></html>
